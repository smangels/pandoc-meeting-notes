# Introduction

## Some Code Examples
Before starting work with GIT everyone should start with setting users name and email address
(refer to [section](#some-code-examples).

~~~~{.bash}
git config --global user.email "your@mail.com"
git config --global user.name "Name Surname"
~~~~
## Adding A Link
For more information refer to the [following article](https://git-scm.com/book/be/v2/Git-Basics-Undoing-Things).

> Note: Every amend operation will get its own SHA because every changed commit message or
file will always affect the SHA.

## Have Fun Writing Meeting Notes

Let's include an image and have some fun.

## Codebox follows a new section, watch for margins

```python
def main():
   pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
   sys.exit(main())
```

## Write Inline Code
Sometimes it is required to write some inline code. It could be used to highlight
names as well. In Linux, one could make use of `nice` in order to change the 
scheduler priority for a certain binary.
