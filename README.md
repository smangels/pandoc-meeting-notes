# pandoc-meeting-notes
Contains a simple template for meeting notes handled by PANDOC

## Handle ePub file formats
Within an epub the title page can be set. In order to do so, place a file called
`cover.jpg` or `cover.png` in the folder img. The script will pick them up when
building an epub document.

Usually the format should be 150dpi and the longest side should not increase 
1000px.
